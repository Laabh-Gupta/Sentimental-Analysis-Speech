# Speech Sentiment and Emotion Analysis

This project aims to detect and classify emotions from speech audio files using machine learning. The model is trained to recognize sentiments like happy, sad, angry, etc., by analyzing various acoustic features of the voice.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About The Project

The primary goal of this project is to build a robust classifier for emotion recognition from audio data. This has applications in customer service analysis, mental health monitoring, and interactive AI systems.

The project involves:
1.  Preprocessing audio files.
2.  Extracting meaningful acoustic features.
3.  Training a machine learning model to classify emotions.
4.  Evaluating the model's performance.

## üìä Dataset

This section should describe the dataset used to train and test the model.

* **Source**: Provide the name and source of the dataset (e.g., RAVDESS, TESS, SAVEE, or a custom dataset).
* **Description**: Briefly describe the dataset, including the number of speakers, the emotions classified, and the format of the audio files (e.g., `.wav`, `.mp3`).
* **Emotions**: List the emotions the model is trained to detect (e.g., Neutral, Calm, Happy, Sad, Angry, Fearful, Disgust, Surprised).

## üéµ Feature Extraction

To enable the model to learn from audio, several key acoustic features were extracted from the raw audio signals.

* **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**: Represents the short-term power spectrum of a sound.
* **Chroma Features**: Captures the harmonic and melodic characteristics of music/speech.
* **Mel Spectrogram**: A spectrogram where the frequencies are converted to the mel scale.
*(Add or remove any other features you used, like Zero-Crossing Rate, Spectral Centroid, etc.)*

## üöÄ Usage

To run the analysis or make predictions, follow these steps.

1.  **Explore the analysis** by running the main Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter lab YourNotebookName.ipynb
    ```
2.  **To predict on a new audio file** (if you have a prediction script):
    ```sh
    python predict.py --input "path/to/your/audio.wav"
    ```

## ü§ñ Model & Results

This section should describe the model architecture and its performance.

*(Please fill in this section with the details from your notebook. Here is a template you can use):*

A **[Your Model, e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or LSTM]** was designed to classify the audio features. The model architecture consists of **[briefly describe layers, e.g., Conv1D, MaxPooling, LSTM, and Dense layers]**.

The model achieved an overall accuracy of **[e.g., 85%]** on the test set.

| Metric         | Score      |
| :------------- | :--------- |
| Accuracy       | **[e.g., 0.85]** |
| Precision      | **[e.g., 0.82]** |
| Recall         | **[e.g., 0.85]** |
| F1-score (macro) | **[e.g., 0.83]** |

A confusion matrix can also be included here to show performance per emotion.
